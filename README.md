# astroDownloader
python script to scrape the date data on each entry in astro.com's databank.

data is current as of 3/29, they will likely add more as time goes on. script takes about 10hrs to run, mostly parsing time on my home server. would probably go faster with optimizations/threading but this allows for not overloading their server with requests and also 10hrs isn't too bad for the purpose i was trying to do

scripts were written by robert kaufmann, abhishek banerjee, and ian klatzco for a MATH199 project at UIUC exploring the birthday paradox. will alexander and tana wattanawaroon offered general probability advice and python advice.
