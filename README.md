# astroDownloader
python script to scrape the date data on each entry in astro.com's databank. not entirely sure about the legality of this but it's probably okay.

data is current as of 3/29, they will likely add more as time goes on. script takes about 10hrs to run, mostly parsing time on my home server. would probably go faster with optimizations/threading but this allows for not overloading their server with requests and also 10hrs isn't too bad for the purpose i was trying to do
